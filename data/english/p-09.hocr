upper curve corresponds to the variations of the correlation scale \ = (f2C)1/(2-™) in the velocity
space. Physically this is the scale at which the square root of velocity dispersion ~ (Crx™)1/2 become
equal to the difference of the regular velocities due to Galactic rotation. The middle curve corresponds
to the variations of the slice thickness L. The darkened area in the Figure depicts to the range of the
turbulence scales under study in Green (1993). The solid curve within the darkened area corresponds
to the interferometric measurements with the baseline 21 m. The lower horizontal line denotes value
of |K|~1 which separates thin (above) and thick slice regimes (below) for cold HI. The contribution
of fluctuations from the warm phase is suppressed when the slices are thin for cold HI and thick for
warm HI (LP99).

a table of idealized phases in Draine &amp; Lazarian (1999) ) is ~ 6 km/s. If the WNM constitutes the
dominant fraction of the neutral phase (Dickey 1995) then the velocity resolution above is optimal
and no further decrease in dV will result in getting new information. However, if close to Galactic
plane Cold Neutral Media constitutes a substantial portion of mass, the increase of velocity resolution
up to 1 km/s is desirable.
