<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 639 1840 839">It is both challenging and important to determine the degree of anisotropy for the
HI statistics for various parts of the Galaxy. This information can provide an insight
to the nature of HI turbulence and may be used as a diagnostic for the interstellar
magnetic field. For instance, measurements of the structure functions of HI intensity

magnetic field direction in various portions of the sky, if the turbulence is anisotropic
as we expect it to be. This technique is somewhat analogous to a technique of finding
magnetic field direction using the fluctuations of synchrotron radiation (see Lazarian
1992) but its applicability may be much wider.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 1223 1840 1420">So far, the attempts to measure anisotropy in HI are limited to the Green (1994)
study, where no anisotropy was detected. Apparently a better analysis is needed. For
the slices with high degree of anisotropy the statistical technique can be improved as
suggested in L95.

The question is what part of them is real, i.e. is associated with density enhancements
in galactic coordinates and what part of them is produced by velocity fluctuations. A
related question is whether the structures we see are produced dynamically, through
forces, e.g. self-gravity, acting on the media or they may be produced statistically
exhibiting the properties of random field. The second question was partially answered
in Lazarian &amp; Pogosyan (1997), where it was shown that density fluctuations with
Gaussian distribution and power spectra result in filamentary structures. The struc-
tures become anisotropic and directed towards the observer when the velocity effects
are accounted for] (see Lazarian 1999, fig. 2).

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 2086 1840 2381">The issue of density enhancements produced by velocity fluctuations is closely
related to the statistics of “clouds” observed in PPV space. The results on velocity
mapping that we discussed earlier suggest that spectra of fluctuations observed in
PPV velocity slices are more shallow than the underlying spectra. This means more
power on small scales or, in other words, more small scale structure (“clouds”) appears
in the PPV slices due to velocity fluctuations.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 2384 1841 2629">It has been believed for decades that emission cloud surveys (see Casoli et al.
1984, Sanders et al. 1985, Brand &amp; Wouterloot 1995) provide a better handle on the
actual spectrum of cloud mass and sizes than the extinction surveys (see Scalo 1985)
because the velocity resolution is available. These two sorts of survey present different
slopes for clump sizes and the difference cannot be accounted through occlusion of

<p class="ocr_abandon" title="bbox 295 2651 1838 2813">6Tt was noticed by Langer, Wilson &amp; Anderson (1993) that more structure is seen in PPV space
than in the integrated intensity maps.

’There is a distant analogy between this effect and the “fingers of God” effect (see Peebles 1971)
in the studies of large scale structure of the Universe.
