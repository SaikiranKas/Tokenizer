view of the discussion above it looks that extinction survey may be closer to the
truth, while a lot of structure detected via analyzing PPV cubes is due to velocity
caustics. Paradoxically enough, emission data integrated over the spectral lines may
provide a better handle on the distribution of cloud sizes compared to high resolution
spectral-line data cubes. Averaging over velocity results in the distortions of the cloud
size spectra due to occlusion effects, but these effects can be accounted for using the
formulae from Scalo &amp; Lazarian (1996).

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1154 1844 1404">The formalism was described above in terms of HI power law statistics. It is obvi-
ous that it can be modified to deal with arbitrary statistics and with a variety of
emission transitions. Here we briefly discuss complications which a generalization of

the technique in order to be applicable to molecular clouds and ionized media may
encounter.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1572 1841 1872">A considerable number of researchers believes that self-similar behavior reflected in
power law statistics is a characteristic feature of the interstellar turbulence including
the molecular cloud turbulence (see Elmegreen &amp; Falgarone 1996). However, some
researchers (e.g. Williams 1999) see departures from a power law, e.g. signatures of
a characteristic scale. In those cases, one still can find the underlying density and
velocity statistics solving forward and inverse problems (see Lazarian 1999).
</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1878 1841 2126">To solve the forward problem one needs to use expressions for the observable
statistics, e.g. expressions for 2D and 1D spectra in PPV space (see eqs (A) and ({16))
and fit the observable statistics varying the input of the velocity and density statistics.
Naturally, the question of uniqueness for such solutions emerge, but with a reasonable
choice of input parameters one may hope to avoid ambiguities.
</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 2132 1840 2729">A different approach involves the inversion of input data. Inversion also requires
a model, but for the case of turbulence studies the model can be quite general and
usually includes some symmetry assumptions, like the assumption of isotropy or axial
symmetry of turbulence statistics (Lazarian 1994a, L95). For the case of turbulence
the inversion has been developed for statistics of density (L95, Lazarian 1993) and
magnetic field (Lazarian 1992, Lazarian 1994a). A remarkable property of the inver-
sion for turbulence statistics is that it allows analytical solutions, which shows that
the inversion is a well posed procedure in the mathematical sense. The procedure
for inverting velocity data should be analogous to inverting density &amp; magnetic field
statistics, but has not been developed so far. We expect wide application of forward
and especially inverse problem technique when the deviations from self-similar behav-
ior become apparent in the data.
