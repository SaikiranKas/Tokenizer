Doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on turbulent velocity field which is
otherwise difficult to measure. However, the problem of separation of velocity and density fluctuations
is far from being trivial. Using atomic hydrogen (HI) as a test case, I review techniques applicable to
emission line studies with the emphasis on those that can provide information on the underlying power
spectra of velocity and density. I show that recently developed mathematical machinery is promising
for the purpose. Its application to HI shows that in cold neutral hydrogen the velocity fluctuations
dominate the small scale structures observed in spectral-line data cubes and this result is very
important for the interpretation of observational data, including the identification of clouds. Velocity
fluctuations are shown to dominate the formation of small scale structures that can be erroneously
identified as diffuse clouds. One may argue that the HI data is consistent with the Goldreich-Shridhar
picture of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, but the cascade from the scales of several kpc that this
interpretation involves does not fit well in the current paradigm of energy injection. The issue whether
magnetic field does make the turbulence anisotropic is still open, but if this is the case, I show that
studies of emission lines can provide a reliable way of determining magnetic field direction. I discuss
various techniques for studying interstellar turbulence using emission lines, e.g. spectral correlation
functions, genus statistics and principal component analysis.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 2214 1840 2514">The interstellar medium is turbulent and the turbulence is crucial for understanding
of various interstellar processes. Interstellar turbulence occurs in magnetized fluid and
magnetic field establishes a connection between ISM phases (McKee &amp; Ostriker 1977)
thus making the turbulent cascade much more complex and coupling together cosmic
rays and gas. Theoretical understanding of such a multiphase media with the injection
of energy at different scales (Scalo 1987) is extremely challenging.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 2519 1841 2815">In terms of the topic of the present meeting, turbulence is important both for
accelerating cosmic rays and for their diffusion. Indeed, whatever mechanism of cos-
mic ray acceleration we consider, its understanding requires proper accounting for
scattering of cosmic rays by turbulent magnetic field. The same is true for the prop-
agation of cosmic rays. For instance, if it were not for magnetic field lines wandering,
the diffusion of cosmic rays perpendicular to the magnetic field direction would be
