<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 298 618 1843 914">In the studies of Large Scale Structure the hierarchical amplitudes were calculated
for various initial conditions to compare with observations. In interstellar media it is
advisable to compare various regions of sky using the tool. Impediments for the use of
the technique stem from the increase of noise with the use of multipoint statistics and
the problems of averaging along the line of sight. The problems should be addressed
in the future.

</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1076 1841 1376">A wavelet technique (see Gill &amp; Henriksen 1990, Langer, Wilson &amp; Anderson 1993,
Rauzy, Lachieze-Rey &amp; Henkiksen 1993) is discussed in this volume by Stutzki who
proposed a so called A- variance technique (Stutzki et al. 1998) which is is related
to wavelet transforms (Zielinsky &amp; Stutzki 1999). Wavelets potentially are a versatile
tool that can filter out the large scale inhomogeneities of the data and concentrate
the analysis on the scales of interest (see Stutzki, this volume).

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 1380 1840 2428">Another useful statistical tool is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This
tool was employed to spectral line imaging studies of the interstellar medium by Heyer
&amp; Schloerb (1997). The goal of the PCA is to determine a set of orthogonal “axes” up,
for which the the variance of the data is maximized. In the case of the data in n points
with p velocity (spectrometer) channels for each point the data can be presented as
6T,; = T;; — (Ti;)n, where T;; is the temperature at the channel j at a position 7 and
(...)n denote averaging over positions. Maximazing the variance means maximizing the
expression Yjj;Yij = UikSjkUsj, Where summation over the repeating indexes is implied
and Six, = (6T;;5Tj%)n. In practice finding of u;; amounts to solving a set of eigenvalue
equations S;,uz; = Auij. To visualize the variance related to /-th principal component
eigenimages are constructed from the projections of T;; onto the eigenvector, i.e. Ith
eigenimage at point (ri) is OTij;u1,;. Heyer &amp; Schloerb (1997) showed that using PCA
technique it is possible to decompose large-scale spectroscopic images of molecular
clouds. Their analysis enabled them to calculate the velocity - scale relations for
a number of cloud complexes. In terms of the statistical analysis presented above,
PCA provides a means of filtering out large scale features responsible for the largest
contribution to the global variance. This makes the sample more homogeneous and
suitable for describing using correlation functions and power spectra. The potential
of this statistical tool is to be further explored. It is likely that combining the various
set of data (for instance, HI and CO) more interesting correlations can be obtained
via PCA technique.

in order to study interstellar turbulence via emission lines. For instance, we omitted a
discussion of 3D correlation functions in PPV space introduced in Perault et al. (1986).
We did not cover studies of turbulence using centroids of velocity (see Dickman 1985)
