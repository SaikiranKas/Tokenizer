<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 663 1840 1110">One can argue that a possible hint in favor of HI density being short wave dom-
inated comes from molecular data discussed in Stutzki et al. (1998). There for both
CO (data from Heithausen &amp; Thaddeus (1990) and Falgarone et al. (1998)) and
13CO (data from Heyer &amp; Schloerb (1997)) transitions the spectrum of intensity was
observed to have a power law index ~ —2.8. As the data is averaged over velocity, the
fluctuations of intensity are due to density fluctuations and the spectrum of density
should have the same slope as the spectrum of emissivity (L95), provided that the
transitions are optically thin. The problem is that they are not thin and therefore the
analysis above is not applicable.

</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 1810 1840 2508">It is natural to expect that dynamically important magnetic field makes interstellar
turbulence anisotropic (Montgomery 1982, Higton 1984). Indeed, it gets difficult for
hydrodynamic motions to bend magnetic fields at small scales if the energy density
of the magnetic field and hydrodynamic motions are comparable at large scales. The
turbulence in ionized gas has been found to be anisotropic and its Kolmogorov-type
spectrum of plasma density fluctuations observed via radio scintillations and scatter-
ing (see Armstrong et al. 1995 and references therein) has been interpreted recently
as a consequence of a new type of MHD cascade by Goldreich &amp; Sridhar (1995). The
Goldreich-Shridhar model of turbulence] differs considerably from the Kraichnan one
(Iroshnikov 1963, Kraichnan 1964). It accounts for the fact that hydrodynamic mo-
tions can easily mix up magnetic field lines in the plane perpendicular to the direction
of the mean field (see discussion in Lazarian &amp; Vishniac 1999). Such motions provide
eddies elongated in the field direction and the velocity spectrum close to the Kol-
mogorov one.
</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 2510 1841 2712">The Goldreich-Shridhar turbulence is anisotropic with eddies stretched along mag-
netic field. The wavevector component parallel to magnetic field ky scales as Kel 3
where k, is a wavevector component perpendicular to the field. Thus the degree of
anisotropy increases with the decrease of scale.
