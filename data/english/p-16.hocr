By 2D maps we mean here maps integrated over the emission line, i.e. total intensity
maps.

deviations from the mean. It is obvious that if one raises the density threshold from
the mean, the low density regions coalesce and the genus becomes more positive. The
opposite is true if 4, decreases. Thus for Gaussian fluctuations one expects genus to
be antisymmetric about zero, but the actual distributions should be able to reveal
“bubble” or “meatball” topology of various parts of the ISM. Algorithms exist for
calculating genus for 2D maps, e.g. microwave background maps (Colley et al. 1996)
and therefore the application of genus statistics to interstellar maps is straightforward
(and long overdue).

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1390 1840 1739">The 3D genus statistics (see Gott et al. 1989) in PPV space is less easy to interpret.
As we discussed earlier, a lot of structures there are due to velocity caustics and
the relation of the structures in galactic coordinates and PPV space is not obvious.
However, it seems interesting to apply genus analysis to the PPV space in search
for another statistical tool to distinguish various interstellar regions. After all, SCF
introduced by Alyssa Goodman do not have a straightforward relation to the known
parameters, but are very useful.
