have to be described in terms of underlying velocity and density.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 677 1840 975">A search for tools to deal with the interstellar turbulence has been intensified
recently and this shows that there is deep understanding in the community that
the wealth of observational data must be explored and it is essential to compare
observations and numerical simulations. I personally believe that the development
of theoretical approaches to dealing with data has become at this point not less
important than obtaining the data.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 991 1841 1487">Most of the present review I devoted to dealing with power spectra which reflects
my personal preferences. Although far from being unambiguous, the power spectra
were most intensively studied in hydrodynamics and the MHD theory and therefore
they provide a bridge between idealizations that we partially understand and terra
incognita of interstellar turbulence. Whether this approach is useful for a particular
phase of the interstellar media is not clear a priori. We may or may not have any
self-similarity indicating a turbulent cascade. However, at least for HI it seems that
the approach is promising. Indeed, we managed to relate, although tentatively, the
statistics of 21 cm emission with the statistics of Goldreich-Shridhar cascades. The
next class of objects to study using the technique should be molecular clouds.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1503 1841 1753">Although studies of molecular clouds are expected to face more problems, some of
them mentioned earlier on, it is likely that the underlying 3D statistics will be soon
obtained for the optically thin molecular lines. Comparison of this statistics with
that in diffuse media should provide an insight to the nature of interstellar turbulent
cascade and turbulent support of molecular clouds.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 298 1770 1841 2114">However, the limitations of the power-spectrum approach make it necessary to
use alternative tools such as wavelets, genus statistics, principal component analysis
and develop new ones such as spectral correlation function even though the relation
between their output and the familiar notions from hydrodynamics is not always
clear. In studies of interstellar medium one has to address particular questions, e.g.
the question of star formation and therefore appearance of specialized tools is only
natural.

</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 2387 1841 2586">1. Velocity and density power spectra can be obtained from observed emissivities.
Velocity fluctuations make emissivity spectra in velocity slices shallower. This results
in much of small scale structure in PPV space that can be erroneously interpreted as
interstellar clouds or clumps.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 2601 1840 2701">2. Turbulence is likely to be anisotropic with magnetic field defining the anisotropy
direction. This should allow a new way of studying magnetic field.
