&amp; Pogosyan (1999, henthforth LP99). There it is assumed that the velocity of a gas
element can be presented as a sum of the regular part v’°9 which can arise for instance
from Galactic rotation, and a random, turbulent, part u, so that v°* = v9 + u.
The mapping from real space to PPV coordinates corresponds to a transformation

(i.e. xy-plane) and use z, for the velocity coordinate. The parameter A is just a
conversion factor which specifies the units of z, coordinate and it is intuitively clear
that this factor should not enter any final expressions for turbulence statistics. On
the contrary, the shear parameter f = (5v%°9/5z)~* is an important characteristic
of the mapping and one expects it to influence our final results. For Galactic disc
mapping it is convenient to choose A = f, while studies of isolated clouds correspond
to a zero shear, i.e. f~' + 0. As most work on HI has been done so far on Galactic
disc HI, to simplify our presentation we use the former choice. With this definition of
space-velocity mapping LP99 obtain the power spectrum P; in the PPV space:

presence in the right-hand side of the first equation in (2). The factor e~/ 7K LUT where
ur is a thermal velocity of atoms originates from averaging over thermal distribution
and it shows that only supersonic motions are readily available for statistical studies.
Note, that expressions similar to and (B) were earlier obtained by Scoccimarro
et al. (1999) in the framework of studies of Large Scale Structure of the Universe
and this confirms the similarity of the problems studied in the two fields. However,
the problem of “redshift-space” corrections to the statistics of galaxy distribution
(Kaiser 1987) has been addressed either in the linear regime when perturbations are
small or when the velocity contribution to the Fourier spectrum can be factorized by
a Maxwellian factor (see Hamilton 1998). The problem that is dealt in turbulence
case is much richer as one has to deal with non-linear density fields transformed by
coherent velocities.
