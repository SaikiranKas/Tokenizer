Power law spectra were also reported for molecular 1*CO (data from Heithausen &amp;
Thaddeus 1990 and Falgarone et al. 1998) and 1°CO (data from Heyer &amp; Schloerb
1997) lines and it looks that power law spectra are quite generic for interstellar tur-
bulence (Armstrong et al. 1997). Thus the assumption of a power law statistics does
not tangibly constrain the range of applicability of the developed theory}
