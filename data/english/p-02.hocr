along magnetic field lines is also substantially influenced by magnetic turbulence.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 668 1840 1165">In view of a broader picture, turbulence is widely believed to be an important
element of molecular cloud dynamics and star formation process, although various
authors disagree on the degree of its importance (see discussion in Vazques-Semadeni
&amp; Passot 1999). Undoubtedly turbulence is essential for heat transfer in the inter-
stellar medium. It has been recently suggested that turbulence is also a key element
to understanding various chemical reactions (Gredel 1999) and of the fundamental
problem of MHD, namely, to the problem of fast magnetic reconnection (Lazarian &amp;
Vishniac 1999). This very limited and incomplete list of processes for which turbu-
lence is essential explains the motivation behind the attempts to study interstellar
turbulence.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1171 1839 1769">Unfortunately interstellar turbulence remains a mystery in spite of all the at-
tempts to study it. Substantial progress in numerical research (see Ostriker 1999,
Vazquez-Semadeni &amp; Passot 1999) is not adequate to reproduce the flows comparable
in complexity and in Reynolds numbers, and the situation will not change in any
foreseeable future. Thus only direct observational studies of interstellar turbulence
may provide us with the crucial information on this phenomenon. Approaching the
problem one would like to know at least the statistics of density, velocity and magnetic
field. In this review I briefly discuss what information emission lines can supply us
with. I would like to quote Alyssa Goodman, who believes that present day technology
made spectral-line mapping of large portions of interstellar media “a booming cot-
tage industry”. Attempts to use this wealth of observational data via visual inspection
become fruitless and this calls for the introduction of more sophisticated techniques.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 1773 1839 2469">Statistical description is a nearly indispensable strategy when dealing with tur-
bulence and a big advantage of statistical techniques is that they extract underlying
regularities of the flow and reject incidental details. Attempts to study interstellar tur-
bulence with statistical tools date as far back as the 1950s (see Horner 1951, Kampe
de Feriet 1955, Munch 1958, Wilson et al. 1959) and various directions of research
achieved various degree of success (see reviews by Kaplan &amp; Pickelner 1970, Dickman
1985, Lazarian 1992, Armstrong, Rickett &amp; Spangler 1995). Studies of turbulence
statistics of ionized media were successful (see Spangler &amp; Gwinn 1990, Narayan 1992)
and provided the information of the statistics of plasma densityf] at scales 108-10! cm.
This research profited a lot from clear understanding of processes of scintillations and
scattering achieved by theorists (see Goodman &amp; Narayan 1985, Narayan &amp; Goodman
1989). At the same time the intrinsic limitations of the scincillations technique are
due to the limited number of sampling directions and difficulties of getting velocity
information.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 299 2477 1839 2672">Deficiencies in the theoretical description have been, to our mind, the major im-
pediments to studies of turbulence using emission lines. For instance, important sta-
tistical studies of molecular clouds (Dickman 1985, Dickman &amp; Kleiner 1985, Miesch
&amp; Bally 1994) have not achieved the success parallel to that in scintillation studies.
