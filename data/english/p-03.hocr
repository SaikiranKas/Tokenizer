tantly, velocity information allows one to distinguish between static structures and
dynamical turbulence.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 714 1840 1058">The difficulty of studying Doppler broadened lines stems from the fact that one
has to account for both velocity and density fluctuations. Indeed, at any given velocity
the fluctuation of emissivity may arise both from the actual blobs of gas moving at
this velocity and from parcels of gas with different spatial positions but accidentally
having the same component of velocity along the line of sight. Therefore fluctuations
of emissivity at a given velocity would be expected even if the media were completely
incompressible.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 298 1063 1841 1557">There exist various ways of dealing with position-position-velocity (henceforth
PPV) data cubes. One of them is to identify clumps and to describe their statistics
(see Stutzki &amp; Gusten 1990, Williams, de Geus &amp; Blitz 1994). Another is use a more
traditional set of hydrodynamic tools like power spectra, structure functions etc. The
two statistics are interrelated (see Stutzki et al. 1998), but in general the relation
between various tools is non-trivial. It seems that for answering various questions
different statistical tools are more suitable. Therefore it is very encouraging that a
number of techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (see Heyer &amp; Schloerb
1997) and Spectral Correlation Functions (Goodman 1999, Rosolowsky et al. 1999)
have been recently introduced to the field.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1561 1840 2407">In what follows I depart from a traditional statistical hydrodynamics and de-
scribe how the 3D velocity and density power spectra can be extracted from position-
position-velocity (PPV) data cubes. This choice reflects my subjective preferences
and partially motivated by the fact that this approach relates the long-studied 3D
density and velocity statistics (e.g. power spectra) with the observational data. Even
with this limitation the scope the subject is too broad and I shall mostly talk about
atomic hydrogen (HI) studies, that can be viewed as a test case for the technique. I
discuss advantages of using HI as a test case in section 2, the problem of space-velocity
mapping in section 3 and spectra in velocity slices in section 4. The interpretation of
21 cm Galactic and SMC data is given in section 5. Possible anisotropies of statistics
stemming from magnetic field are dealt with in section 6, where a new technique for
statistical studies of magnetic field is suggested. I consider formation of emissivity en-
hancements that can be identified as filaments and clouds in section 7 and discuss the
generalization of the technique in section 8. Being aware of the limitations of the tra-
ditional hydrodynamic description of turbulence, we describe alternative approaches,
i.e. 2D Genus statistics, Spectral Correlation Functions and Bispectrum in section 9.
A short discussion of the results is given in section 10.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 295 2567 1840 2815">Atomic hydrogen is an important component of the interstellar media and many
efforts have been devoted to its studies (see Burton 1992). In terms of turbulence
studies it has a number of advantages. For one thing, when dealing with HI one
may in most cases disregard self-absorption. There are two major reasons for that:
self-absorption is small (Braun 1997, Higgs 1999) and as shown in Lazarian (1995,
