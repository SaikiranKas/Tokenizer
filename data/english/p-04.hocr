influence the statistics on the scales larger than their size. For another thing, the
pervasive distribution of neutral hydrogen presents a sharp contrast to the localized
distribution of molecular species, and this alleviates problems related to averaging.
Moreover, atomic hydrogen emissivity is proportional to the first power of atomic
density and this simplifies the analysis.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 865 1840 1110">HI has a substantial filling factor (~ 20% or larger) in the Galactic disc and
therefore its motions should reflect large scale galactic supersonic turbulence. At the
same time, its statistics may have connection with the statistics of molecular clouds.
An additional advantage of HI is that it can be studied not only within our Galaxy
but for the nearby galaxies as well.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1116 1841 1612">Another motivation for studies of HI statistics stems from the recent attempt to
describe the structures in the Galactic hydrogen in order to estimate the fluctuations
of microwave polarization arising from interstellar dust. This contribution is extremely
important in view of present-day efforts in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
research (see Prunet &amp; Lazarian 1999, Draine &amp; Lazarian 1999). Some of the studies,
for instance one by Sethi, Prunet and Bouchet (1998), attempts to relate the statistics
of density observed in the velocity space and the statistics of polarization fluctuations.
If such a relation were possible, it would greatly alleviate the efforts to study polariza-
tion of cosmological origin. As an intermediate step in this work, however, one should
relate the statistics in emissivity in the PPV space and density of HI in real space.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 298 1616 1841 1761">The timing for developing statistical tools for HI studies is also influenced by the
fact that new large data cubes, e.g. the Canadian Galactic Survey data (see Higgs
1999), should become available soon.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 298 2066 1841 2563">The notion that the velocity fluctuation can influence emissivity within PPV data
cubes is not new. Since the early-seventies Butler Burton on numerous occasions
claimed the importance of velocity fluctuations for the interpretation of 21 cm data
(Burton 1970, 1971). The ambiguities of inferring cloud properties from CO emission
lines were discussed by Adler &amp; Roberts (1992). Using N-cloud simulations of spiral
disks they showed that many spurious effects appear because of velocity blending
along line of sight. Recently a number of researchers doing numerics (Pichardo et al.
1999, Vazques-Semadeni 1999) pointed out that pixel-to-pixel correlation between the
channel maps and the velocity slices of PPV data cubes tends to be larger with the
velocity rather than the density field.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 2566 1840 2761">To describe power spectra of velocity and density fields, i.e. to express the inter-
stellar statistics using the language that was so successful in hygrodynamics (Monin
&amp; Yaglom 1972), one needs to disentangle velocity and denisty contributions to 21 cm
emissivity fluctuations.
