D function. In this case S function gets sensitive to similarities in the shape of two
profiles. Fixing /, s or both parameters one can get another 3 function that are also
sensitive to similarities in amplitude, velocity offset or to both parameters.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1142 1841 1637">The purpose of those functions is to distinguish regions with various star forming
activity and to compare numerical models with observations. To do this histograms
of SCF are compared with histograms of SCF obtained for the randomized spatial
positions. This allows to models to be distinguished on the basis of their clustering
properties. First results reported by Rosolowsky et al. (1999) are very encouraging.
It was possible to find differences for simulations corresponding to magnetized and
unmagnetized media and for those data sets for which an earlier analysis by Falgarone
et al. (1994) could not find the difference. The mathematical development of this new
tool is under way (Padoan et al. 2000) and we expect new exciting results to be
obtained in the near future.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 295 1639 1840 2283">A few comments about spectral correlation functions may be relevant. First of all,
by its definition it is a very flexible tool. In the analysis of Rosolowsky et al. (1999)
the SCF were calculated for the subcubes over which the original data was divided. In
this way SCF preserves the spatial information and in some sense is similar to cloud-
finding algorithms (see Stutzki &amp; Gusten 1990, Williams, de Geus &amp; Blitz 1994).
However, one may fix the angular separation between the studied spectra and then
the technique will be more similar to the traditional correlation function analysis
that is sensitive to turbulence scale rather than to positional information. I believe
that this avenue should be explored in future along with other more sophisticated
techniques that can be applied to SCF. At first glance, it looks counterproductive to
get a whole lot of various correlations using SCF as the input data. However, we must
find a way of distinguishing regions with various physical properties and we are still
in search for the best descriptors.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 2288 1844 2582">At the moment the distinction between various interstellar regions and the sets of
simulated data is made by eye examining the histograms of SCF. With more informa-
tion available it seems feasible to use wavelets that will emphasize some characteristics
of the histograms in order to make the distinction quantitative. Construction these
wavelets will be the way of “teaching” SCF to extract features that distinguish various
sets of data.
