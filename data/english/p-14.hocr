</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 641 1841 990">As we discussed earlier, one of the advantages of using HI as a test case is that the
emissivity is proportional to the column density. This is true for some optically thin
transitions in molecular clouds, but fails when absorption is important. My analysis
showed that the absorption is relatively easy to account for if it arises from dust,
but much harder to deal with if it is self-adsorption. In the former case most of the
analysis above is valid provided that the turbulence scale under study is much smaller
than the extinction length.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 299 995 1840 1240">Homogeneity of sample is another major concern for studies of turbulence in molec-
ular clouds (see Houlahan &amp; Scalo 1990). Filtering the data (see Miesch &amp; Bally 1994),
application of wavelets (see Stutzki et al. 1998) or both are required. However, it seems
that as the resolution of data improves the effects of cloud edges get less important
and easier to take care of.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1245 1843 1443">Some emissivities, e.g. those of Ha lines are proportional to the squared density of
species. However, it is possible to generalize the technique above for those transitions
and provide a quantitative treatment of turbulence in ionized emitting media, e.g. of
HII regions (O’Dell 1986, O’Dell &amp; Castaneda 1987).

</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 1617 1840 1716">The approach that we discussed so far can be characterized as an interpretation of
the emissivity spectrah] in terms of the underlying statistics of velocity and density.
</p>
<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1720 1840 1966">The advantage of this approach is that no numerical inversion (see Lazarian 1999)
is performed and thus one should not worry about increase of the data noise. The
power spectra are widely used in hydrodynamics and therefore there is hope to relate
the statistics of interstellar turbulence with something simple and more familiar like
Kolmogorov-type cascade.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 1972 1839 2416">In spite of all these advantages, the information that this approach can supply
us with is limited. Indeed, media clustered by self-gravity and more diffuse media
may have the same index of power spectrum, while being very different. In general,
statistical measures borrowed from hydrodynamics may not be adequate while deal-
ing with interstellar media. Indeed, we have to address particular questions, e.g. the
question the identification of star-forming regions, which are beyond the standard
hydrodynamic description. Therefore attempts to introduce new descriptors are wor-
thy of high praise. It may happen that in answering specific questions one has to use
particular descriptors.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 294 2565 1838 2664">A new tool termed “spectral correlation function” or SCF has been recently intro-
duced to the field (Goodman 1999, Rosolowsky et al. 1999). It compares neighboring

<p class="ocr_abandon" title="bbox 294 2693 1838 2813">8 In fact we do not distinguish between spectra and correlation functions. The two statistics are
related via Fourier transform and provide an equivalent description. In some particular circumstances
one or the other may be more convenient, however.
