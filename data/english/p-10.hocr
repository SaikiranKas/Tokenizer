spectra in the thin slice regime depends on whether n is larger or smaller than —3. If
n &gt; —3, Po, is dominant and the observations by Green (1993) reveal the spectrum
with index n+-m/2. For m = 2/3 the spectrum of emissivity obtained by Green (1993),
namely the emissivity with the index ~ —2.7, corresponds to n ~ —3. If, however, the
density spectrum is steep (ie. n &lt; —3), the fluctuations of 21 cm intensity observed
by Green (1993) can arise from velocity fluctuations. In this case the spectral index
is —3+ m/2. For m = 2/3 one gets the slope —8/3 + —2.7 which is exactly what is
observed. The question now is whether nature conspires to create the density spectrum
with n ~ —3 and thus make the slopes of P:, or Pe, identical in thin slices or we
observe P,, while n &lt; —3.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 295 1114 1840 1710">To answer this question one has to consider thick slices of data. Unfortunately,
for thick slices of data one has to account for lines of sight being not parallel. This
problem was studied by Lazarian (1994) for the case of density statistics, but the
study has not been generalized so far for the case when both density and velocity
contribute to emissivity. Thus external galaxies provide a better case for study thick
slices. Data for Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) in Stanimirovic et al. (1999) shows the
steepening of the slope from ~ —3 for the slices obtained with the maximal velocity
resolution to n + —3.5 for data integrated over the entire emission line (Stanimirovic,
private communication) which corresponds to our theoretical predictions for long-
wave dominated density spectrum with the index n ~ —3.5. Thus the set of Green’s
and Stanimirovic’s data is consistent with an interpretation that both velocity and
density exhibit spectra close to Kolmogorov.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 298 1714 1842 2010">A potential difficulty of “Kolmogorov” cascade interpretation is that the SMC
data show power-law slope up to 4 kpc scale. To explain Doppler broaderning of
molecular lines one has to accept that the energy is being injected at large scales.
However scales of several kpc look excessive. Injection of energy at such large scales
is possible in the form of superbubles, but the details and the very possibility of the
cascade in these circumstances is unclear.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 2163 1840 2359">The “Kolmogorov” interpretation above apparently needs further testings. There are
various pieces of evidence that could be interpreted in favor of the spectrum of density
being shallow, i.e. + —3. However, our analysis shows that this interpretation is not
substantiated.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 297 2365 1841 2662">For instance, Braun (1999) reports a power law index of —3 for the spectrum of
21 cm emission from structures near the North-East major axis of M31 galaxy. How-
ever, he uses not the whole spectral lines, as we do in our treatment but the maximal
values of velocity only (Braun 1999, private communication). The interpretation of
this result in terms of the power spectra as discussed in L95 and LP99 is impossible,
as the treatment of data is very different.
