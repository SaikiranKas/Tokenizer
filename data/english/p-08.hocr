<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 295 1331 1842 1529">It is easy to see from Table 1 that in thin slices the velocity mapping makes the
spectra more shallow (as m &gt; 0). This means that velocity creates a lot of small scale
structures. It is also evident that if the n &lt; —3 the Py, contribution dominates. In
the opposite regime P:, contribution is important.

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 1578 1840 1878">The relative importance of P:, and P2, depends on whether n &gt; —3 — m/2 orn &lt;
—3—m/2. In the former case P2, dominates, while for the latter P2, becomes dominant
only when the slice is very thick, i.e. a substantial portion of the line is integrated
over. Indeed, it is easy to see that integration over the line-width leaves only density
information. In the intermediate situation if the density spectrum is steep, i.e. n &lt;
—3 —m/2 Ps, provides most of the contribution to Pp».

<p class="ocr_plain_text" title="bbox 296 1882 1841 2178">For warm HI the thermal velocity dispersion is comparable with the turbulent
one. Thus fluctuations of intensity arise mostly from density inhomogeneities and
the analysis in L95 is applicable. The amplidude of fluctuations arising from the
warm phase of HI is suppressed due thermal velocity smearing effects. Therefore in
the mixture of the warm and cold phase the contribution of the cold phase to the
measured spectrum is likely to dominate (LP99).

His observations of the HI emission were accomplished with the Synthesis Telescope
of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) towards | = 140°, b = 0°
(03"03™23*, +58°06/20’, epoch 1950.0) and they revealed a power law spectrum of 2D
intensity. This spectrum is proportional to P2(K)|- and its interpretation depends on
whether the slicing is thick or thin. To answer this question one has to estimate
the dispersion of turbulent velocity at the scales under study and compare it to the
velocity thickness of the slice (see eq. (13) and (14). Assuming that velocity variations
